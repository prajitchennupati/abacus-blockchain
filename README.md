# abacus-v1.0

The Abacus blockchain is an up and coming system to transfer, store, and secure ABCs. The purpose of the blockchain is to create a foundation for third parties who may want to build their own blockchain. Essentially, Abacus is the starting point for all your needs; just like how the Abacus was the starting point for the modern day calculator.

Please note that this is the first iteration of the Abacus blockchain and more iterations will follow suit. Some major features which the blockchain lacks is most noticably a working and intuitive UI as well as a means of storing data.

Abacus V2.0 will feature a means of storage and Abacus V3.0 will feature a working UI.

Eventually the Abacus blockchain will be hosted on the web where people can use the blockchain to transfer, store, and secure their ABCs which is the underlying coin for the blockchain (similar to how ETH is the underlying coin for the Ethereum blockchain). For Abacus V1.0 a limit of 200,000 ABCs exist per run and no more can be created.

Some limiations to existing blockchain networks were addressed in this iteration of Abacus (most notably not being able to send ABCs to ghost wallets, a feature not included in prominent blockchains like Bitcoin). More limitations will be addressed later in various sectors of the blockchain such as mining, transparency, security, etc.

FEATURES:
- Working Blockchain With Hashing
- Wallet Creation
- Transfer Of Funds Between Wallets
- Unique Wallet Credentials
- Ability To Log Into Wallet
- Viewing Of On-System Blockchain

A Message From The Coder (Prajit):
Hey guys, this project took me a while to curate and build and I got to say I had a lot of fun making it! I hope to advance Abacus and make it easier to use!
